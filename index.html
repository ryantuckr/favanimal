<h1>My favorite animal is a fox</h1>

<img src="../favanimal/foxphoto.jpg">

<p>The fox is the my favorite animal. The fox has 4 legs and a body. The face consists of a nose, eyes, and ears.
    There is also some colored fur. The fox lives on planet earth and mainly leaves humans alone. Fox probably shouldn't be eaten.

<h2>Dont eat Fox</h2>
